## Introduction
Provide a brief introduction to the project, the goal of the project, and relevant information.

## Installation

Following installed on your system:

- Python (>=3.6)
- pip (Python package manager)

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Preetha122825/Predicting-house-prices-using-Machine-Learning.git


Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd house-price-prediction


## Dataset

You need to acquire the dataset for house price prediction. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. You can obtain such datasets from sources like Kaggle or other real estate databases.

   ## Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing

## Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Code Structure

The codebase is organized as follows:


- house_price_prediction/
    - data/
        - house_data.csv
    - models/
        - house_price_model.pkl
    - notebooks/
        - data_exploration.ipynb
        - model_training.ipynb
    - src/
        - data_preprocessing.py
        - model.py
    - app.py
    - requirements.txt
    - README.md


- `data/` directory: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/` directory: Where the trained machine learning model will be saved.
- `notebooks/` directory: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- `src/` directory: Python source code for data preprocessing and model creation.
- `app.py`: A sample script to demonstrate how to use the trained model for predictions.

## How to Run

install jupyter notebook in your command prompt
   ## pip install jupyter notebook (or)
       Download Anaconda community software for desktop
       install the anaconda community
       open jupyter notebook
       type the code &execute the given code
 
To run the prediction application, use the following command:

bash
python app.py


The app will prompt you to enter house features, and it will provide a predicted house price based on the trained model.

## Data source

The dataset used for this project is obtained from [Kaggle] ([ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vedavyasv/usa-housing][https://www.kaggla.com/datasets])

## Data Description

The dataset consists of various features describing residential properties, including information like the number of bedrooms, Areas and more.  The target variable is the Price of the houses.  This data suitable for training and testing machine learning models for house price prediction.

## Results

After running the application, you will receive predicted house prices based on the input features.
